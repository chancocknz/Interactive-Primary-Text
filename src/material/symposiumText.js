//     "APOLLODORUS: I believe I am quite well prepared to relate the events 172a you are asking me about, for just the other day I happened to be going \
//     into Athens from my home in Phalerum1 when an acquaintance of mine caught sight of me from behind and called after me, jokily,2 \
//     ‘Phalerian! You there, Apollodorus! Wait for me, will you?’
//     So I stopped and waited.
//     ‘I have just been looking for you, Apollodorus. I wanted to get from
//     you the story about that party of Agathon’s with Socrates, Alcibiades
//     and the rest, the time when they were all together at dinner, and to hear 172b what they said in their speeches on the subject of love. Someone else
//     was telling me, who had heard about it from Phoenix, son of Philippus,
//     and he said that you knew about it too. Actually he could not give any
//     clear account of it, so you must tell me. You are in the best position to
//     report the words of your friend.3 But tell me this first’, he went on.
//     ‘Were you at that party yourself or not?’
//     ‘It certainly looks as if your informant was rather confused’, I replied, 172c ‘if you think the party you are asking about occurred recently enough
//     for me to be there’.
//     ‘Yes, I did think so’, he replied.
//     ‘But how could you think so, Glaucon?’ I said. ‘Don’t you know that it is now many years4 since Agathon lived in Athens, and it is not yet three years since I began to associate with Socrates and to make it my daily business to know everything he says and does? Before that I used to think I was achieving something when I was in fact running round in circles aimlessly, in the most miserable state, just like you now, and I thought philosophy5 was the last thing I should be doing’.
//     ‘Don’t make fun of me’, he said. ‘Just tell me when that party took place’.
//     ‘When you and I were still boys’, I replied, ‘in the year when Agathon won the prize with his first tragedy6 and on the day after he and the members of the cast held the sacrificial feast to celebrate the victory’.
//     ‘Oh, then it really was a long time ago’, he replied. ‘But who told you about it? Was it Socrates himself?’
//     ‘Certainly not’, I said. ‘It was actually the man who told Phoenix, someone called Aristodemus of Cydathenaeum, a small man, who never wore any shoes. He had been at the party, and I think there was no more devoted admirer7 of Socrates at that time. But of course I asked Socrates myself some questions afterwards about what I had heard from Aristodemus, and he confirmed what Aristodemus had said’.
//     ‘Then’, said Glaucon, ‘do tell me. The city road is in any case convenient for conversation between fellow-travellers’.
//     So it happened that as we went on our way we talked about the speeches, with the result that, as I said at the beginning, I am quite well prepared. If you really want me to recount them to all of you as well, then that is what I had better do. Anyway, whenever I talk myself on any philosophical subject or I listen to others talking, quite apart from thinking it is doing me good I enjoy it enormously. But when I listen to other kinds of discussion, especially from people like you, rich money-makers, I get
//     bored on my own account and at the same time I feel sorry for you, my companions, because you think you are achieving something when you are achieving nothing. On the other hand you perhaps believe that I am the 173d one who is unfortunate,8 and I suppose you are right. But in your case I
//     don’t merely suppose you are unfortunate, I know it.
//     FRIEND: You are quite incorrigible, Apollodorus. You are always
//     disparaging yourself and everyone else as well. I really do believe you think everyone except Socrates is miserable, starting with you. However you got that nickname, ‘Softy’,9 I cannot imagine. You are always like this when you speak, raging against yourself and everyone else except Socrates.
//     APOLLODORUS: Obviously then, my dear friend, if I think as I do 173e about myself and all of you I am completely mad!
//     FRIEND: It is not worth quarrelling about these things now, Apollodorus. Please do what we asked you and tell us what they said in their speeches.
//     APOLLODORUS: Well then, those speeches went something like this –
//     no, I shall begin at the beginning and try to tell you the whole story as 174a Aristodemus told me."
